# Thickness Estimation from Time-of-Flight Data

**(!Documentation is not finished yet!)**

## About the Project
This project was prepared as the final assignment of "Recent Advances in Machine Learning" course during my master study in University of Siegen. 


## Introduction
The thickness of the material strongly affects the material impulse response function (MIRF). Thus, the Fourier samples of the MIRF, obtained from the ToF camera, can be used to extract the thickness information as well. Various neural network architectures were designed to predict the real material thickness from ToF based features.
